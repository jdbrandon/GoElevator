Elevator Algorithm
==================

This simulation is designed to replicate a moving disk head traversing different tracks
on the disk and servicing tracks as requests are made asynchronusly.

TODO: add doucumentation, maybe throttle request frequency up and down a little over time. Add more to this readme
